# Evaluating and Benchmarking DoubletDecon for Doublet Detection in scRNA-seq

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to evaluate DoubletDecon with different parameters, benchmark with Scrublet and DoubletFinder and explore the strength of DoubletDecon.

## Workflow
Before starting, please make sure installing all the packages and dependencies, such as Scrublet, DoubletFinder and DoubletDecon

The parameters testing result is produced through running DoubletDecon_parameter.R file

For the benchmarking, please running DoubletDecon_bench.R, DoubletFinder_bench.R and Scrublet_bench.R file.

All the graph in the report can be reproduced through graph.R file
